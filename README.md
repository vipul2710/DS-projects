Sales Data Cleaning Pipeline (Python & Pandas)

This project demonstrates a complete, best-practice data cleaning workflow using Python and pandas.
Starting from a messy, real-world sales dataset, I applied structured techniques for data exploration, missing value treatment, text normalization, categorical encoding, and numeric outlier handling.
The project emphasizes writing clean, modular, and reproducible codeâ€”mirroring how professional data engineers and analysts build robust data pipelines.
